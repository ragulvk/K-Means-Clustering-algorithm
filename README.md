# Implementation of K-Means Clustering Algorithm
## Aim
To write a python program to implement K-Means Clustering Algorithm.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation

## Algorithm:

Step1
import the necessary packages.

Step2
Read the csv file.

Step3
Scatter plot the applicant income and loan amount.

Step4
Obtain the kmean clustring for 2 classes.

Step5
Pretict the cluster group of Applicant Income and Loanamount.

## Program:
~~~
